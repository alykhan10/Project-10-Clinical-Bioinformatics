# Project #10: Clinical Bioinformatics
# Obtaining Expression Pathways for The Cancer Genome Atlas Project

● Generated an oncoplot in R to visualize mutation summaries for 4000 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma                  
● Clustered samples based on disease progression, obtaining Kaplan-Meier curves with a significant p-value of 0.048                
● Performed differential analysis to extract the top 10 regulated pathways for the TTN, TP53 and MUC16 genes
