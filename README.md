# Project 8: State Machines
# Compiling a Hierarchical Chart to Model the Driving Logic of a Robotic Vacuum

● Encapsulated behavior of the autonomous device with 4 operating modes; off, vacuuming, docking, and charging                      
● Established a super-state for the pseudo-random driving pattern, with pure rotation and translation as substates           
● Captured the supervisory logic with a Stateflow model that logged sensor data for desired and angular velocity
